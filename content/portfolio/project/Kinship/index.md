‘Kinship’ is a simple tool that finds out what are the related words (kins) to a particular word that twitter users have twitted.

Twitter users tweet (post status) about any topic within the character limit, making it a powerful medium of information sharing.
For example, if we take into account the word Wimbledon, this tool will fetch the twitter stream of all tweets containing the word Wimbledon, and display the top n most related words - like Federer, Tennis, Champion, record etc. as expected.
